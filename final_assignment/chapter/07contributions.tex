\section{Maximilian Elfers}

The main task was the creation of the preprocessing code and workflow of the raw videos. During the course of the semester another big task was the continous training of models on PALMA, which turned out to be more difficult than hoped, because of technical problem on PALMA with YOLO. \\
In the written assignment the contribution was the related work and discussion chapter and shared tasks for the methods and results chapter.

\section{Timo Lietmeyer}
I was able to help with the preprocessing code and converting the bounding boxes. During the course, training on PALMA with YOLO was another challenge. I was able to help the other two very well with setting up YOLO on Palma. \\ In the written assignment, I wrote the fundamentals part and was able to help with further chapters.

\section{Hendrik Lüning}
A major part of the work was the conversion of the bounding boxes described in \ref{ch:methods}, which involved setting up the build-dataset script and adapting it to the RGB data. As there were many problems with this script, a lot of debugging was done. Once the build-dataset script was complete, the focus shifted to training the models.\\
In the final draft, the introduction and, in collaboration, the methods-, results- and discussion-section were added.
