\section{Maximilian Elfers}

The main task was the creation of the preprocessing code and workflow of the raw videos. During the course of the semester another big task was the continous training of models on PALMA, which turned out to be more difficult than hopen, because of technical problem on PALMA with YOLO. \\
In the written assignment the contribution was the related work chapter and shared tasks for the methods, results and discussion chapter.

\section{Timo Lietmeyer}
I was able to help with the preprocessing code and converting the bounding boxes. During the course, training on PALMA with YOLO was another challenge. I was able to help the other two very well with setting up YOLO on Palma. \\ In the written assignment, I wrote the fundamentals part and was able to help with further chapters.
